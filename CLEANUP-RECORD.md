# Project Cleanup Record

## Overview
This document records all the files that were removed during the project cleanup to reduce clutter and improve maintainability. All removed files were temporary, test, or setup files that are no longer needed for the production application.

## Files Removed

### Database Setup and Test Scripts
These were temporary scripts used during initial database setup and testing:

- `check-database-with-token.cjs` - Database connection testing with specific token
- `check-database.cjs` - Basic database structure verification
- `check-supabase-database.cjs` - Supabase API testing with access token
- `comprehensive-fix.cjs` - Comprehensive database fix testing
- `create-test-user.cjs` - Test user creation script
- `final-database-check.cjs` - Final database verification
- `final-setup.cjs` - Complete database setup script
- `run-database-fixes.cjs` - Automated database fix application
- `run-fixes.cjs` - General fix application script
- `setup-database.cjs` - Database setup automation
- `setup-environment.cjs` - Environment configuration testing
- `test-connection.cjs` - Connection testing with environment variables
- `test-db-connection.cjs` - Basic database connection test
- `update-config.cjs` - Configuration update script

### SQL Setup Files
These SQL files were used during initial database setup:

- `database_fixes.sql` - Critical database fixes for React application
- `essential_backend_fixes.sql` - Essential backend functionality fixes
- `complete-database-setup.sql` - Complete database schema setup

### Documentation Files
These were temporary documentation files created during setup:

- `FIXES-APPLIED.md` - Record of fixes applied during development
- `SETUP-COMPLETE.md` - Setup completion documentation
- `RUNBOOK.md` - Operational runbook (moved to proper location)
- `COMPLETE-SETUP-GUIDE.md` - Comprehensive setup instructions

### Development Scripts
These were development utility scripts:

- `scripts/cleanup-unused-imports.js` - Script to remove unused imports
- `performance-optimizations.js` - Performance optimization utilities

### Corrupted Files
- `lib/supabase.ts.corrupted` - Corrupted backup file

## Why These Files Were Removed

### 1. Database Setup Scripts
- **Purpose**: These scripts were created to set up and test the database during initial development
- **Reason for Removal**: Database is now properly configured and these scripts are no longer needed
- **Alternative**: Database schema is maintained through Supabase migrations in `supabase/migrations/`

### 2. Test and Verification Scripts
- **Purpose**: Used to verify database connections and test CRUD operations
- **Reason for Removal**: Application now has proper testing infrastructure
- **Alternative**: Use `npm test` or integrated testing tools

### 3. Temporary Documentation
- **Purpose**: Documented setup processes and fixes during development
- **Reason for Removal**: Information has been consolidated into main documentation
- **Alternative**: Refer to main README.md and project documentation

### 4. Performance Scripts
- **Purpose**: Client-side performance optimizations
- **Reason for Removal**: Optimizations have been integrated into the build process
- **Alternative**: Performance monitoring is handled by the application's built-in tools

## What Was Preserved

### Essential Files Kept
- `package.json` - Project dependencies and scripts
- `vite.config.ts` - Build configuration
- `tailwind.config.js` - Styling configuration
- `tsconfig.json` - TypeScript configuration
- `supabase/` directory - Database migrations and configuration
- `src/` directory - All application source code
- `public/` directory - Static assets

### Important Documentation Kept
- `README.md` - Main project documentation
- `AUDIT.md` - Security and code audit information
- This file (`CLEANUP-RECORD.md`) - Record of cleanup activities

## Benefits of Cleanup

1. **Reduced Clutter**: Removed 20+ unnecessary files
2. **Improved Navigation**: Easier to find important files
3. **Cleaner Repository**: Better organization for development team
4. **Reduced Confusion**: No more temporary or outdated files
5. **Better Maintainability**: Clear separation between production and development files

## If You Need the Removed Files

All removed files are available in the Git history. To recover any file:

```bash
# View file history
git log --follow -- path/to/file

# Restore a specific file from a previous commit
git checkout <commit-hash> -- path/to/file
```

## Database Setup Instructions

Since the setup scripts were removed, here's how to set up the database:

1. **Use Supabase Migrations**:
   ```bash
   npx supabase db reset
   npx supabase db push
   ```

2. **Manual Setup**:
   - Go to your Supabase SQL Editor
   - Run the migration files in `supabase/migrations/` in order

3. **Environment Configuration**:
   - Copy `.env.example` to `.env`
   - Add your Supabase URL and keys
