## 🔴 CRITICAL ISSUES (Immediate Action Required)

### 1. **Featured Products Filter Logic Error**
- **Issue**: `products.filter(p => p.featured)` in ProductsPage.tsx line 158
- **Database Field**: Uses `is_featured` not `featured`

- **Fix**: Change to `(b.is_featured ? 1 : 0) - (a.is_featured ? 1 : 0)`

### 2. **Missing Pagination Implementation**
- **Issue**: No pagination system implemented
- **Impact**: Poor performance with large product catalogs, bad UX
- **Current**: Shows all products at once
- **Fix**: Implement proper pagination with page size controls

### 3. **Inconsistent Search Implementation**
- **Issue**: Different search logic in ProductsPage vs SearchPage
- **Impact**: Inconsistent search results across pages
- **Fix**: Centralize search logic in a custom hook

### 4. **No Search Analytics**
- **Issue**: No tracking of search queries, results, or user behavior
- **Impact**: Cannot optimize search experience or understand user intent
- **Fix**: Implement search analytics and tracking
